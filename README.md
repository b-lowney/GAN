This repository contains the code for training and predicting a GAN on seismic data, originally for the purpose of diffraction separation. 
The trained model for diffraction separation can be found at the above link alongside some open-source data courtesy of the USGS which can be used to test the code.
Alongside this, PWD data of the same seismic dataset is provided which can be used for comparison. 

GAN code was written using templates on machinelearningmastery.com.
